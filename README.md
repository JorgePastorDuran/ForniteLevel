# ForniteLevel

I've led the design and development of a Fortnite level, with the invaluable support of Momentum Worldwide and direct supervision and approval from Epic Games. What can I say? For me, it's a dream come true, especially addressing such a vital topic as health.
Alzheimer's affects millions and is one of the most damaging and widespread diseases. It was crucial for us to address this topic with respect while showcasing the reality as it is.

Streamers who've played it have amassed over 7 million followers. Additionally, it's been featured in various state newspapers and media outlets. I greatly appreciate the dissemination to raise awareness about this disease.

If you'd like to experience it, the island code is: 🌐 7230-3324-3779
